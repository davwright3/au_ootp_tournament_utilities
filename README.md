## Getting Started

### Initial Startup

- Set window sizes (1920x1080 recommended)
- Set target folders and files for file processing

  - RECOMMENDED:  Have one main folder for your processed files and individual raw data folders for each tournament
  - Setting targets is not mandatory but is recommended for improving your workflow

### File Processing

- Export file as a CSV from your "Sortable Statistics" page

  - By default, this file will be automatically exported to your "\<user>\OOTP Developments\OOTP Baseball XX\online_data" folder

- Move this CSV to your raw data folder for the currently working program
- In the File Processing application, select the target (destination) file for your main tournament data and 
the folder you are importing data from
- Press the "Process Files" button and all CSV's in the folder that are not already in the file will be added
- NOTE: The application uses the name of the file to determine whether it is already in the target dataset (i.e. 24 May)
- NOTE: I expect the initial release of the statistic to use DateTime for sorting, with a future update being able to 
manage between DateTime and integers.  For now, I recommend labeling your raw data in DD MMM format.  I will advice when
this becomes obsolete.
